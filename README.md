# ImmersiveHUD
Immersive HUD or iHUD for short is a small immersive mod for 7 Days to Die. The intent of the mod is to add water and food indicators back into the game after they were removed in Alpha 13. One of the major goals of this mod was to add the food and water bars back into the game in a way that makes the mod feel like it's part of the base game.
